## **Technologies Used**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### **How the Game works**

- Click on the **_Roll Attack_** button a series of success and failure checks are performed.
- If the user gets three successes a critical success occurs, on the other hand three failures results in a critical fail.
- The user needs two or more successful checks to obtain a random damage number based on the player characters stats.
- Two or more fail checks results in the user's player character taking damage.
- As the rounds go up the damage scaling increases.
- The user's player character can regain hit points on each critical success rolls.
- The user must click the **_Next Level_** button to progress the game loop.
- The user can click the **_Reset_** button to start over.
